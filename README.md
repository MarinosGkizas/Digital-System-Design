# Digital-System-Design
This is a project for the subject Digital Systems Design of the CEID in University of Patras. We are working with the tools of Synopsys(Atlanta and Hope), in order to produce test vectors for combinational and full-scan sequencial circuits, run DRC and simulate these circuits with faults.
